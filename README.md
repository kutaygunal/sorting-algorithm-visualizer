# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

A modern, interactive web application that visualizes common sorting algorithms in real-time. This project helps users understand how different sorting algorithms work through animated visualizations.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort

- **Interactive Controls:**
  - Adjustable array size (10-100 elements)
  - Real-time visualization
  - Start/Stop functionality
  - New array generation

- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Number of comparisons
  - Number of swaps
  - Visual progress tracking

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Modern UI with Flexbox)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Font Awesome Icons

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Use the slider to adjust the array size
3. Click on any sorting algorithm button to start the visualization
4. Use the "Stop" button to halt the current sorting process
5. Click "New Array" to generate a new random array

## Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort
- Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
- Visualized with element comparisons and swaps

### Quick Sort
- Time Complexity: O(n log n) average case
- Space Complexity: O(log n)
- Visualized with pivot selection and partitioning

### Merge Sort
- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
- Visualized with divide and merge steps

## Visual Features

- Color-coded elements to show:
  - Current elements being compared
  - Sorted portions
  - Pivot elements (in Quick Sort)
  - Merged subarrays (in Merge Sort)
- Smooth animations for better visualization
- Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
